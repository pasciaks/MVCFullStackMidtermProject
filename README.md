#### Description

-R.E.P.E.A.T.
-Recursive Eternity Pilot Education And Training

-EPIC: Military pilots are tasked with maintaining a constant state of readiness. This includes their academic, medical and clearance certifications of good standing as well as the certification that they are up to date with required flight training/experience. By logging each flight a pilot completes along with the details of the training/practice that occurred on these flights, the sum of all experiences can be compared to the total number of time requirements that are determined necessary. When the pilot meets or exceeds these requirements, they are regarded as combat ready and sufficiently trained to for the specific types of aircrafts the pilot is tasked with operating.

-INITIATIVE: Create a web based, mobile friendly website that allows for the tracking of pilot qualifications for various aircraft. The site should be able to easily identify any shortcoming in pilot experience needed to be regarded as fully qualified/combat ready.
